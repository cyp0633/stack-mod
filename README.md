# stack-mod

This is a modified version of [hugo-theme-stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack), and it's not intended for public use. The fork is created for [my blog](https://cyp0633.icu).

New features include:

- Support for Artalk comment system
- Copyright link
- Removal of PhotoSwipe
- Collapsed content
- Optimized page width

If you insist on using it by yourself, please remember:

- It may not function the same as the original theme
- Some of my personal blog information is hardcoded
- You must follow GPLv3, but whether to include me as author is up to you
